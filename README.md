# ZKP-based-scholarship-verification-system
A rule-based neural network model evaluates scholarship eligibility using three numerical inputs: GPA, family income, and test score. Encoded logical thresholds (GPA ≥ 8.5, income ≤ ₹100,000, score ≥ 85) determine binary classification. Exported to ONNX for ZK-compatible inference verification.
